<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>At LREC 2000 in Athens the first workshop<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> about metadata concepts for making language resources visible in and discoverable via the Internet was organized by some of the authors. At LREC 2002 two groups demonstrated operational frameworks for creating metadata for language resources and to work with them for management and discovery purposes. While OLAC<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> (Open Language Community Archives Community) started form a Dublin Core point of view with the goal to create a set that allows for the description of all types of language resources, software tools, and advice, the IMDI<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> (ISLE Metdata Initiative) activities started with a slightly different approach. The focus was primarily on multimedia/multimodal corpora and a more detailed set was worked out that can be used not only for resource discovery but also for exploitation and managing large corpora. Most importantly, IMDI allows its metadata descriptions to be organized into linked hierarchies supporting browsing and enabling data managers to carry out a variety of management tasks.</p><p>The two years since 2002 have been used to improve the metadata sets based on the experience of the communities. They have also been used to create an interoperable domain, i.e., a mapping schema was worked out between the IMDI and OLAC sets and the IMDI domain acts as an OLAC data provider. IMDI records can be searched for from the OLAC domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IMDI Metadata Set 3.0.3</head><p>Based on the experiences and on a broad discussion process including field linguists, corpus linguists and language engineers, the IMDI set 3.0.3 was designed as part of the INTERA project<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> and is available as an XMLschema. It was adapted to simplify the content description and the artificial distinction between collectors and other participants probably influenced by Dublin Core was removed. Three major extensions were applied: First, it is now possible to describe written resources. This was necessary, since most language collections contain written resources in the form of transcriptions, field notes, sketch grammars, phoneme descriptions and others more. Second, as a consequence of long discussions with participants of the MILE lexicon initiative, it is now possible to describe lexicons with a specialized set of descriptor elements. Third, it is now possible to define and add project-specific profiles. In the earlier version IMDI supported already the possibility of extensions at various levels in the form of user defined category-value pairs, i.e., the user was able to define a private category and associate values with it. This feature was used by individuals and also projects to include special descriptors, however, these descriptors were not fully supported by the IMDI tools. In the new version, however, projects or sub-domains such as the Dutch Spoken Corpus respectively the Sign Language community can define a set of important categories and these are supported while editing or searching.</p><p>Therefore, IMDI exists of its core definitions that have to be stable to assure users that their work will be exploitable even after many years and of sub-community specific extensions, which nevertheless are result of discussion processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IMDI Framework</head><p>Further, the IMDI initiative came up with a whole bunch of professional and tools 5 for the latest metadata set version 3.0.3 such as  a professional and mature Editor that allows users to create fully IMDI compliant metadata descriptions and that supports all IMDI features such as controlled vocabularies and project specific profiles  a handy browser that allows navigating in the distributed domain of linked metadata XML files supporting searching as well as browsing, the setting of bookmarks etc (fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>)  a tree-builder that allows the user to create new userspecific virtual trees by linking arbitrary metadata descriptions and creating arbitrary nodes  on-the-fly transformed HTML presentation of the metadata files that allow users to browse in the linked metadata domain with normal web-browsers (fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>)  a full-text search tool that gathers all metadata information and treats it like unstructured information in particular for untrained users  an access management system fully integrated with the metadata domain (fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>)  a wrapper that offers IMDI records according to the OAI MHP (metadata harvesting protocol)</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> shows the interface of the XML-based special browser that offers advanced functionality.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the interface for browsing in the metadata domain with the help of normal HTML presentations. The location is indicated by showing the path.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distributed Metadata</head><p>Metadata that is going to be used for discovery purposes has to be distributed, i.e., the individual descriptions can be stored at different servers. The OAI model defines data and service providers both related via the metadata harvesting protocol that defines the interaction pattern and the packaging. The data providers have to provide Dublin Core records to achieve semantic interoperability. However, the OAI protocol also allows to send records specified by another schema such as IMDI. Based on this information service providers can build services for example for searching that cover a large group of different repositories working internally with different metadata sets.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the home page that allows to manage users, groups and access rights. This management tool is closely related to metadata to provide administrative efficiency.</p><p>Although the OAI protocol is comparatively simple to implement, the common praxis is still to harvest XMLfiles. The ECHO project has shown that most of the institutions are not yet prepared to support OAI. The IMDI metadata infrastructure was assuming from the beginning that metadata records can be located at various institutionseven on the notebook of remotely working fieldworkers. Therefore, IMDI metadata records can be linked in a simple waysimilar as web-sites. The browser only needs a registered URL to integrate the IMDI descriptions into the domain. For searching, the IMDI tools will scan all known metadata links and create indexes that can then be exploited.</p><p>However, all IMDI tools expect IMDI type of metadata records, i.e., IMDI is not a concept for establishing interoperability between different metadata sets. Within the ECHO project an integrated metadata domain was built that includes ten different repositories from five different disciplines. It was shown that interoperability at the structural level was mainly achieved by harvesting XML-structured files and at the semantic level by creating special mappings (Wittenburg, 2003/2004). The Dublin Core approach reduces too much of the semantic richness of the provided information. Therefore, it is seen just as another view on the data. This new emerging domain including the activities of about 27 partners includes textual corpora, national speech corpora, multimedia/multimodal corpora, parallel corpora, lexicons and various types of written resources.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Critical Mass of Metadata</head><p>Yet we don't have a final estimate about the number of individual resources that will be described and available at the end of 2004 when the two mentioned projects will be finished. At the Max-Planck-Institute there are currently about 30.000 sessions described by metadata. Large corpora such as SMARTKOM, the Dutch Spoken Corpus, the LABLITA corpus and the ATILF corpus will be part of the new domain, so we can expect that there will be many more resource units described and therefore searchable.</p><p>It is hoped that this emerging domain is large enough to demonstrate the usefulness of metadata for discovery purposes and that it will inspire others to participate. The ENABLER<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">7</ref> overview has clearly indicated that there is a lack of visibility of language resources in the Internet and that their accessibility is even worse. Therefore, the creation of metadata must be a high priority program to foster re-usage. In a declaration agreed upon at the ENABLER meeting in Paris in 2003 it was stated that the funding agencies should make the generation and integration of proper and openly available metadata descriptions according to one of the two currently existing standards (OLAC or IMDI) obligatory.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Metadata Creation Process</head><p>In the first phase of INTERA and ECHO various European data centers and research institutions were approached whether they are interested to participate in creating an integrated metadata domain. The initiative had good resonance, i.e., most reacted in a positive way. However, the knowledge about the principles and goals of metadata creation and the expectations were very different. Some expected a larger amount of funding support and did not see that metadata is not meant to clean up the state of their repositories.</p><p>Most of the data centers that finally participated were aware of the relevance and concept of metadata. Therefore, there was no need for intensive training programs. However, since these centers with large corpora were already using header type of information or some internal database, it was not evident for them that IMDI not only requires metadata records. To create a browsable domain as well it is necessary to create a linked hierarchy of metadata descriptions and meaningful nodes that represent abstract concepts such as "language", "genre" and "age". It would be possible in IMDI to just deliver metadata records, simply create one node representing the institution and link all descriptions to this one node. But that would lead to long and unstructured lists that are not useful for browsing. To help creating such meaningful hierarchies programs would be necessary to create abstractions from the metadata descriptions semiautomatically.</p><p>The experiences with projects and institutions in the ECHO project were different. Here training courses and introductions were necessary to inform the researchers about all aspects of standardized metadata. In general these groups had to start from scratch, since they did not work with formal metadata beforehand. Metadata creation then means a considerable amount of work, since interviews are required and analysis work is needed to fill in the values for the metadata elements.</p><p>In special cases such as the Sign Language community a discussion process was initiated that led to additional categories that were absolutely necessary. Only with categories such as "actor.blind" metadata would be easily exploitable by the members of that specific community. Therefore, the concept of project or community specific profiles was introduced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Problems</head><p>The efforts needed to create metadata descriptions varied considerably as well as the available skills to write scripts to semi-automatically create basic information that can be enhanced manually. Although the IMDI infrastructure offers an editor with useful options to increase the efficiency such as storing and re-using blocks of information, manual metadata creation is very time consuming and often not feasible.</p><p>The experience showed that it is much more easier to use spreadsheet tools such as EXCEL for researchers to create and manipulate a large set of records. The same is true for experienced people that prefer to use scripts to create the metadata records. However, these techniques in general create metadata of bad quality. The following types of problems were encountered:  There is no guarantee that scripts produce wellformed XML files.</p><p> The character encoding often is not UNICODE.  Most problematic is that the tools used do not provide support for the controlled vocabularies leading to typo errors, spelling variants and many others.</p><p>It is the service provider who has to invest time to check the correctness of the produced metadata records and to improve the metadata records in collaboration with the data providers. The OAI 8 model that requires a validation at the moment of registration and simply points to the errors is in general not sufficient. Without additional help many of the data providers would stop.</p><p>Improving the content of the metadata descriptions is very important for successful searching. Two phenomena can be observed: (1) Since metadata creation is a hard job, even in evident cases elements are not filled in.</p><p>(2) As already indicated all kinds of variations can be found, since the creators partly do not make use of controlled vocabularies.</p><p>First, in a very large collection it is a problem to identify such errors or missing values. Second, how to correct them without starting time consuming interactions with the various data providers. To detect errors and variants it makes sense to first run a validation against the controlled vocabularies. Until now, however, the errors have to be corrected manually. Methods that use a formal closeness (one character difference) or other type of heuristics were not yet applied. Variants that occur due to language differences (for example Afrique, Afrika, Africa) could be corrected if one would have suitable online dictionaries or terminology databases.</p><p>Third, filling in empty elements is even more difficult, since there can be many reasons why elements were not used. Until now these cases were identified by accident, i.e., someone inspecting metadata records, finding that for example the country is filled in but not the continent. A script using geographic thesaurus information could very easily add information in such a simple case. If the "genre" field, however, is not filled in there is no simple chance to identify this except by producing long lists. Still it would not be evident how such fields have to be filled in, since only the researchers can do this.</p><p>Another aspect that was found during the metadata creation work is that many institutions are looking for institutions that can store there collections. They don't have the human resources to organize them and maintain them in a proper state so that they can be used by others. So we need ingest tools that easily allows researchers to hand over their data to another institution in an easy way.</p><p>At the MPI such a system is currently in work. Ingestion will be tightly combined with metadata creation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future</head><p>Much effort is taken to create and maintain metadata descriptions and it is expected that projects such as INTERA and ECHO will help to increase the awareness that metadata is very important. Therefore, we have to <ref type="bibr">8</ref> Open Archives Initiative: http://openarchives.org assure that the investments will be maintained over a long period.</p><p>All IMDI categories were registered within the emerging ISO TC37/SC4 data category repository. In doing so semantic definitions are carried out in a widely agreed and machine readable way. It is expected that also OLAC and TEI categories will be entered in the same way. This would give all definitions a higher degree of stability. It would also allow us to make the semantic mapping between the categories explicit. It would also open the possibilities that researchers create their own mappings between categories and even develop own metadata sets by re-using the existing and well-defined categories.</p><p>It is expected that creating metadata will also become more attractive when new applications will become available. The INTERA project has as one other goal to link the domain of language resources with that of tools that operate on such resources. The MIME type concept is not new, however, the requirements go far beyond this. Bundles of resources have to be processed by tools combining several of them in one step. Characteristics of resources such their annotation schemes are relevant to detect the most useful tool. Within the INTERA project an interaction between the IMDI domain and the ACL tool registry <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">9</ref> is being developed that is based on the open Language Resource Exchange Protocol (LREP).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In this paper we presented the metadata creation work in the INTERA and ECHO projects and the experiences that were made. The creation of high quality metadata descriptions in general costs more effort than was originally expected. Given that many researchers still see metadata creation as an overhead, makes infrastructure projects of this sort a difficult, but nevertheless important enterprise.</p><p>A sufficiently large metadata domain is expected to become available this year. To convince other institutions and individuals to contribute to this domain more utilities have to be developed to easily create large sets of metadata descriptions, to derive corpus-structured semiautomatically and to enrich the content.</p></div>			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="1" xml:id="foot_0"><p>http://www.mpi.nl/ISLE</p></note>
