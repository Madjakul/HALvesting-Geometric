<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Computer mediated communication (CMC) tools are used to produce and exchange an enormous amount of contents such as emails, chats and fora. But these contents are usually little or not structured, which makes the automatic extraction of knowledge difficult. In this paper, we tackle the issue of the constitution of threads in conversations within a specific company. This problem strongly relates to that of conversations disentanglement which have been addressed in several research works. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Jiang et al. (2018)</ref> computed message similarity using language representation to address this problem. Such problems requires the existence of a corpus to analyse. It is why <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kummerfeld et al. (2019)</ref> have built a large-scale corpus for conversations disentanglement, also the EN-RON corpus was created by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Klimt and Yang (2004)</ref> for email classification research. In the same way <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chanier et al. (2014)</ref> built the CoMeRe corpus for French and <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Douglas et al. (2015)</ref> created the Avocado Research Email Collection. More recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bevendorff et al. (2020)</ref> built the Webis Gmane Email Corpus from the archive of Gmane mailing list. Among these corpora, some are from ENRON and AVOCADO companies, but they are in English and their content have specific contexts different from those of the company of which we will create a corpus. Those that are in French have very few emails around 2030 (CoMeRe) or are mailing list conversations with themes and context that do not fit with corporate conversations. One approach could be transfer learning, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bornea et al., 2020)</ref> use multilingual transfer learning for question answering problem. But the context of a company is very circumscribed and specific.</p><p>In this paper we describe a method for building a corporate corpus based on emails data. We specifically address the process of collecting, preprocessing and pseudo-anonymizing emails in order to meet legal, personal, acceptability and social constraints. This comprises the use of models for Named Entity Recognition (NER), rule-based systems and their evaluation. In the upcoming sections, we will present research works on corpus building and constraints related to it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Building a corpus is a prerequisite step to various research work in different fields such as discourse analysis, automatic translation and transcription, image recognition, emails segmentation, named entities recognition, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chanier et al. (2014)</ref> built the CoMeRe corpus for discourse analysis and carried out linguistic studies of idiolects that appear in different types of CMC. The CoMeRe corpus consists of heterogeneous CMC in French including 3 million chats, 44K SMS, 2,030 emails, 2,700 forum messages and 34k Tweets.</p><p>Automatically classifying emails in specific email directories and extracting information from them are issues that led to the creation of the EN-RON Corpus by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Klimt and Yang (2004)</ref>, a corpus of emails in English from a private company. The ENRON corpus has been widely used: email formalities in work environments are studied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Peterson et al. (2011)</ref>, also <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chhaya et al. (2018)</ref> quantify the feelings and tone used in emails.</p><p>In order to disentangle conversations in the same message stream, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kummerfeld et al. (2019)</ref> developed a large corpus of 77,563 messages including 74,963 from Ubuntu's Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel and 2,600 messages from Linux's that highly contribute to research in dialogue analysis.</p><p>Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bevendorff et al. (2020)</ref> developed the largest corpus available named Webis Gmane Email Corpus 2019 consisting of 153 million emails extracted from 14,669 mailing lists. This corpus data exists in three major languages: English, German and French. These emails are segmented into 15 classes of emails by a neural model with a performance of 96%.</p><p>As a whole, the scarcity of reference data in general and in particular for the French language justifies our approach to build a corpus that covers the need of thread analysis in CMC context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Constraints: Legal, personal and psychological</head><p>Certain conditions govern the exploitation of public data, including forum, mailing list or web site data. These types of conditions are generally displayed to and agreed upon by the user when registering for these forums and or mailing lists. Mentions contained in these terms and conditions often refer to the exploitation of user data for the purposes of training, service improvements and or advertising. Unlike this process of joining forums, mailing lists or websites, employees in corporate do not always have to explicitly validate such conditions, but are required to keep secret certain company information on the one hand and on the other hand the private information exchanged in corporate via CMC are governed by the secrecy of correspondence and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) adopted in 2016 and became effective on 25 May 2018 in the European union.</p><p>Personal data protection concerns have been elicited since 1970 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hallinan and Zuiderveen Borgesius (2020)</ref>, with Ann Cavoukain, the Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada, co-author of the 1995 international report on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET) acting as a forerunner in the domain of data privacy in any technological design. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cavoukian (2010)</ref> further clarified that "the future of privacy cannot be assured solely by compliance with regulatory frameworks; rather, privacy assurance must ideally become an organization's default mode of operation".</p><p>With regard to the secrecy of correspondence, it would be a violation if a third party managed to access even a conversation of collaborators without their consent. Our goal of disentangling forum conversations, chats and corporate emails could only be carried out under the respect of the secrecy of correspondence. Thus obliging us to submit consent requests to the various collaborators involved in these conversations. This is a tedious task given the number of collaborators in the different teams or entities in a company.</p><p>In the same vein, the GDPR was established in the European Union territory to protect personal data. It applies to any organisation, public and private, that processes personal data on its behalf or not, provided that it is established in the territory of the European Union, or that its activity directly targets European residents. The GDPR strengthens the obligation of information and transparency towards the persons (collaborators in our case) whose data we process. Despite this obligation of transparency towards collaborators, they are able to exercise their rights of refusal, withdrawal (if committed beforehand) of exploitation of their data. Secure and substitute some information from this data are part of the conditions to be respected in order to be GDPR compliance. These conditions are binding for the data acquisition process because require to set up stable and streamlined processes that include administrative and material aspects.</p><p>The two previous forms of constraints put collaborators at the centre of any data acquisition process in a company. They need to know why and how their data will be used. And depending on the answers given to them, they are free to give their consent or not. Unwillingness to share their content which potentially includes personal or highly sensitive data, brings out another group of con-straints that are personal, acceptability and even psychological.</p><p>All these constraints need to be addressed when dealing with business data acquisition and processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Methodology and Implementation</head><p>Our process is based upon three main stages: collecting conversations, preprocessing them and pseudo-anonymizing sensitive information in these conversations. For the global aim of conversation disentanglement, it is important to mention that the data will be further analysed by a limited number of people from two different teams, one within the company and another the associated public research team. Our goal is to process the data, with anonymization or pseudo-anonymization techniques in particular, so that it is not possible for any person outside that team to identify any participant in the conversations nor to be able to detect participants' personal data. In order to verify our compliance with GDPR and the secrecy of correspondences, our project has gone through an internal validation procedure supervised by a legal commission within the company on the basis of a data life-cycle and a completed risk analysis form. The data life-cycle describes in detail which operations would be performed by which person acting with what role. In particular it helped us identify the possible leaks in the process and their potential consequences. It also specifies that before the anonymization or pseudo-anonymization stage, only specific researcher, who bears the role of technical data controller (TDC) -can access the whole collected data on a secure storage device. The other collaborators in the team can only access the data collected from their own computer. This legal commission evaluated defined the process to follow.</p><p>This process consists first in obtaining a consent from the targeted collaborators. Then, once the data has been collected, any text string that directly or indirectly allows identification of a person or access to personal information must either be removed, modified or pseudo-anonymized. It is worth mentioning that the consent provided by the collaborators is valid for a maximum of one year at a time.</p><p>To obtain collaborators' consent, we produced media content (video and slides) explaining why and how the process of collecting and analysing data would take place. This is to provide transparency, as requested by GDPR. Obtaining a collaborator's consent means having him/her sign a document explaining why we want to collect emails he/she is involved in and under what conditions it is done. For COVID-19 reasons these documents were signed electronically and stored on a secure file system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">First stage: Collecting conversations</head><p>Since our objective was to collect a large corpus of French interactions occurring in the context of computer mediated exchanges in a business environment, we focused specifically on emails since a) these are still widely used in professional context and b) other sources appeared to be more fragmented and difficult to gather in a coherent way. Our main goal is to reconstruct threads from those conversations so that each thread only deals with a clear and well-circumscribed topic. After dealing with emails conversations, we will then explore other types of CMC in corporate such as forums, chats, IM, etc.</p><p>Still, the sole gathering of emails can appear to be a painful task. Beyond the difficulty of just gathering users' consents, the resulting issue is to be able to collect those messages or threads that only relate to the collaborators that have actually given their consent since obviously many threads involve several collaborators. Finally, the technical deployment of the mailing environment (in our case: Microsoft's Exchange server) can in itself be a hindrance to the precise querying and retrieval of the appropriate content.</p><p>As a consequence, we chose to collect emails directly from the collaborators' desktop computers. This choice was guided by two main reasons, namely:</p><p>• It is easier to obtain consents of some targeted collaborators. Aspects of security and confidence are in this way easily approached and collaborators have the full control of what is collected from their computer.</p><p>• It also allows us to limit the extraction to relevant emails, thus preventing that we come across, for instance, emails that the collaborator wants to keep confidential.</p><p>In order to build a corpus of significant size it is necessary to have the consent of a minimum number of collaborators. However targeting collaborators at random proved not to be sufficient. Indeed since we can only collect emails for which all the collaborators involved gave their consent, we would then take the risk of collecting conversations with many missing emails. This would probably result in having a negative impact when extracting meaningful threads from these amputated conversations.</p><p>Our approach was to try to maximise the number of emails/conversations to extract while minimising the number of collaborators to contact. In doing so we distinguished collaborators who gave their consent into two groups, namely: -anchor, are collaborators within our project and with whom we can perform manipulations on their workstation to extract data; -participant, the rest of those collaborators who gave their consent. The above approach is divided into two steps. The first one consists in selecting participant who are"close" to an anchor. The output of this first step is a list of interlocutors that will be used as a guide when selecting potential participant or anchors on other anchor' workstations. The second step is focusing on the actual extraction of emails and conversations on anchor's workstations. During this emails/conversations extraction, we also made sure that we extrated metadata such as senders, receivers, emails and conversations identifiers, dates and times from emails headers. These metadata helped us later for the pseudo-anonymization step and to keep the real links between the different messages of a conversation. To bootstrap this phase we first contacted collaborators from a single team, then from a project, from a larger entity and so on until a substantial amount of data would be collected.</p><p>In a more practical way and because Microsoft Outlook is the application used in the company for emails exchanges, we developed a C# Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> application based on Microsoft Office Interface<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> that allows us to interact with Outlook application and also with backup files from Outlook. With this tool we can select and unselect folders and contacts from a collbaborator's Outlook mailbox. Once the tool is installed on a anchor's workstation, the anchor uses it with the support of one of the people who designed the tool. Thus it is easy for an anchor to choose the emails folders from which the emails may be extracted and to choose the collaborators that could be contacted to become participants. This gives the possibility to avoid folders with private or personal contents and contacts with whom he/she has confidential exchanges. It also helps to provide data in JSON and CSV formats for future processing.</p><p>Until now we have obtained 78 consents from close collaborators involved in shared projects. Based on these 78 consents and as a first stage of data collection, we succeeded in extracting 11K unique emails for a total of 1 023 736 tokens, from the workstations of four anchors (the TDC and three other collaborators of the same team). These emails included conversations dating back to 2013 which shows the extent and richness of the information collected. The current size of this extracted data is 194 MB. These extracted data are only a first part of our final corpus, as we will contact collaborators from other teams and involved in other projects to increase the size of this corpus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Second stage: Preprocessing collected data</head><p>Emails are not structured due to the explosion of different email formats and styles, coupled with the ad hoc ways in which people vary the structure and layout of their messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Carvalho and Cohen (2004)</ref>. Emails contain different zones that can be easily identified by humans. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Estival et al. (2007)</ref>  Preprocessing collected data initially consisted in deleting all duplicated emails, followed by identifying, dissociating or removing content from the quoted conversation and boiler-plates zones. To identify and extract quoted messages and signatures from an email, we used Talon<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> , a python library. This library is inspired from the research work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Carvalho and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cohen (2004) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Joachims (2001)</ref>. As provided, this library works quite well for French e-mails both for the extraction of quoted messages and signatures with an average of predictions of 95% and 70%, respectively, despite the fact that the model within this library has been trained on ENRON corpus, a corpus in English.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the large gap between the number of tokens of an email with its quoted messages(in red on the figure) and without them (in blue). These quoted messages are actually the content of all or some previous emails in a conversation that are added to a new email. To comply with GDPR and the secrecy of correspondence, we started by replacing anything in the email body and subject that could indirectly lead to the identification of any person. Here, we were rather in an anonymisation process as we were trying to keep the semantic logic of sentences while substituting expressions. This meant replacing each email address, phone number, URL, path and any user's identifier respectively by @EMAIL, @PHONE, @URL, @PATH and @ID using python's internal regular expression library<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> . @PATH and @ID correspond respectively to any absolute or relative path of a folder or file and to sequences of text that uniquely identify the corporate collaborators. All these anonymized sequences do not have a great importance for the problem of thread reconstruction.</p><p>Within our collected data, emails are identified by two alphanumeric strings, namely:</p><p>• ConversationID: identifies a conversation, so it is the same for all emails within the same conversation</p><p>• ConversationIndex: is the unique identifier of an email, it contains its conversation identi-fier (conversationID). It helps to know what the position of an email is in the conversation tree.</p><p>We also replace those two strings for each email while keeping emails in their respective conversation and all relationships between emails. This preprocessing step gives us an overview of the substitution method on strings easily identifiable. There are others whose identification is complex and we must find and substitute them. That is why we have conducted experiments of data annotation, Named Entity Recognition (NER) and disambiguation of collaborators names.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Third stage: Entities pseudo-anonymization</head><p>Besides indirect content which leads to the identification of a person in emails body, there are strings directly linked to collaborators such as their first names and last names. Emails body may also contain corporate sensitive data or intellectual property such as project names, tools, groups and/or entities names within it, conversation identifiers or any other kind of identifiers. Because of GDPR and secrecy of correspondence compliance, the identification and substitution of these data is necessary. Identify direct strings listed above or sensitive data is become a general problem for a few decades called Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the field of NLP. A new state of art for French Named Entity Recognition has been recently established by Ortiz Suárez et al. ( <ref type="formula">2020</ref>). However, some prior work has been carried out on NER in context of informal text such as emails. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Minkov et al. (2005)</ref> propose a method based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and combined with rule-based system to extract personal names from emails. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Zhang et al. (2018)</ref> use regular expressions to collect weak labels from web noisy data for the entity mentions and train a neural network to predict those RE-generated weak labels. These work show that regular expressions, rule-based system are still viable approach to Named Entity Recognition despite good results of recent transformers models which need some fine tuning. As our collected data could not be move on a cloud or GPU server for fine-tuning, we were constraint to approach the problem with a simple computer. We combine several approaches including annotation, CRF, fine-tuned CamemBERT 6 on NER task, regular expressions and rule-based system to achieve our goal of identifying and substitute information to be GDPR compliance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Data annotation</head><p>Building up the ground truth for a downstream NLP task is a necessary step and usually corresponds to annotation which is time consuming especially when it is handcrafted. For NER case, tools have been built to accelerate annotations. Prodigy<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">7</ref> and INCEpTION<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">8</ref> are such tools. These are both accessible via web interfaces. In addition Prodigy offers command-line features. They are all based on active learning (AL) defined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ren et al. (2020)</ref> as a method that aims to select the most useful samples from the unlabelled data set and hand it over to the "oracle" (e.g., human annotator) for labelling, so as to reduce the cost of labelling as much as possible while still maintaining performance. As prodigy is not free and INCEpTION needs some time to get hands on it, we used a tool built by a former intern of our team.  This tool is based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and active learning method and as well as being accessible via web interface. From the 11K extracted emails, we selected 1k emails containing at least 142 916 tokens. Three annotators did the annotation exercise on the 1k emails each with Named Entities(NE) tags we defined based on what we considered sensitive information to substitute. Those annotators come from the pool of anchor collaborators from whom we extracted the 11k emails and they annotated a total of 8689 tokens.. They are thus well aware of the general context of the task and therefore ended up being good raters for the task. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> lists the various tags according to the BIO standard. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the annotation statistics. We can see the very low rate of ID, ROLE, LOC and ORG, which is actually due to the pre-processing stage where we extracted signatures that usually contain identifiers (which have been annotated as ID), roles or functions, phone number, and addresses. The very low rate of phone number is also related to the pre-processing stage described in section 4.2 with the use of regular expressions to identify and substitute phone number, email address, url and path (which sometimes contains the company ID of employees). Also UNCERTAIN is low because raters know well the context of emails that they annotated, otherwise we would have had a high number of UNCERTAIN tags. This shared knowledge of the context of annotated emails is also observed on several tags (LOC, ID, TOOL, PERSON) which are not very disproportionate for raters 1 and 2. Rater 3 annotated more PROJECT and TOOL than two others raters, this shows some ambiguity on strings related to those two tags. This effectively reflects the reality of distinction between project and tool because sometimes in a company, a tool developed in a project can bear the same name of the project. There is also such ambiguity between SUBGROUP (for departments or teams in the company) and PROJECT, due to the fact that sometimes a team name is identical to the product being developed. From the 8689 annotated tokens, we identified 236 different annotations among the three raters, in which the SUBGROUP, PROJECT and TOOL categories are predominant. These disparities show that certain concepts in corporate context are not accurate and may be subject to mis-understanding.</p><p>For data annotation, we evaluated inter-annotator agreements (IAA) by means of the standard Cohen Kappa measure McHugh (2012) from the biomedical field. Cohen's Kappa measure is not the most relevant for NER as mentioned e.g. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hripcsak and Rothschild (2005)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Grouin et al. (2011)</ref>, because it requires negative cases that do not exist for NER. Also Cohen's Kappa measure can not be used when there is more than two annotators. Since there are three raters for our data, we use Cohen's Kappa to evaluate pairs of raters (R 1 , R 2 ), (R 1 , R 3 ) and (R 2 , R 3 ). To evaluate nominal interannotator agreements (IAA) with more than two annotators, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Zapf et al. (2016)</ref> advise to use Fleiss's Kappa or Krippendorff's alpha. They study different cases and show that these measures are similar. Annotated data is very unbalanced because of the un-annotated tokens labelled with "O" which are highly represented compared to all existing tokens. As Brandsen et al. ( <ref type="formula">2020</ref>) did, we computed all IAA scores in both cases with all tokens and only with annotated tokens. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref> shows different scores computed, we observe that the scores with all tokens are quite high, but this is due to the bias of non-labelled tokens. Cohen's Kappa on annotated tokens only is substantial agreement with values in [0.61 -0.80] interval according to the interpretations in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Viera and Garrett (2005)</ref> for three pairs of raters. Computed values for both Krippendorff's alpha and Fleiss's Kappa are identical 0.70 and belong to the same previous interval, interpret as substantial agreement. Based on these computed measures and their interpretation, we can find some correlations with diagram on the Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. These annotations made it possible to build a repository of annotated tokens that we combined with CamemBERT-ner results and a rule-based system to pseudo-anonymize our entire data. This combination is what we call data pseudo-anonymization chain represented by Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Data pseudo-anonymization chain</head><p>Pseudo-anonymising sensitive information starts with recognising them, and this is done by NER task. As we use a tool based on CRF coupled with active learning to annotate our data, we test the resulting model on unseen emails and the result was very bad compared to the test performed with CamemBERT-ner 9 , a transformers based model.   From the data annotation stage (carried out on the same 1k emails), there are 6219 identified strings that have been similarly annotated by the three annotators or by two of them. The difference of about 733 entities identified by CamemBERTner compared to manual annotations shows its performance in identifying elements that it cannot classify. This comes from the fact that CamemBERTner has been fine-tuned from CamemBERT on the wikiner-fr data set (∼ 170 634 sentences). We anticipate that we will have compare these results with those obtained with fine tuning CamemBERT on our own data in order to recognise additional entities (tool, project, ID, subgroup, etc.) used by raters during the annotation process.</p><p>As can be seen in figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, the main challenge is to be able to reclassify on these categories those from MISC. Also the organisations recognised by CamemBERT-ner are more than double of those from the annotation and need to be reclassified into other categories like subgroup or project. A rule-based system was used to refine category of entities from MISC. During the annotation process, a repository was built, containing a list of string with their respective tags ( tags from table 1) without duplicates. The rule-based system consists of comparing strings identified as miscellaneous by CamemBERT-ner with same from the annotation repository and finally use his tag (defined by raters) to refine miscellaneous category. This Refining stage helps the rule-based system in creating semantic code for the substitution of those strings from emails content ans subjects. Created codes look like user xxxxxxxx, org xxxxxxxx, tool xxxxxxxx respectively for identified collaborators, organisations, tools and this same coding pattern was used for all other entities classes. When substituting collaborators first names or last names or both in an email, the rule-based system checks sender or recipients of the email to keep the email and conversation thread context. While running, the rulebased system builds a new repository containing all pairs of substituted string and their respective code. This repository is call correspondence table and could be use later to rebuild emails and subjects without codes but strings which was substituted before. Below is an example of a paragraph before and after pseudo-anonymisation. The above paragraph contains bold text segments that are names of collaborators and companies that have been replaced by code as in the pseudoanonymised text below.</p><p>Les espaces de coworking sont plutôt traités dans le misc 55e6a en cours de rédaction par user 8e47d, user c6f1d, user 5ff59.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Future work</head><p>After obtaining pseudo-anonymised data, we will analyze this data in order to approach the problem of threads constitution with its inherent problems including conversation disentanglement, dialog acts identification and text segmentations. To reconstruct conversation threads, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Domeniconi et al. (2016)</ref> propose an approach that combines similarity calculations of 8 features built from each email. These features actually bring out the context of an email. Taking into account the context of messages or emails allowed researchers of Yahoo and Amazon <ref type="bibr">Avigdor-Elgrabli et al. (2018)</ref> to automatically evaluate the semantic relationship between messages within a mailbox.</p><p>Regarding conversation disentanglement, Elsner and Charniak (2010) and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Elsner and Charniak (2011)</ref> approach chat disentanglement by first using binary classifier and local Coherence Models one year later. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Jiang et al. (2018)</ref> take advantage of learning language representations to disentangle conversations. compute similarities between messages using a model they name Siamese Hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network (SHCNN) which is a Siamese hierarchical convolutional network.</p><p>SegBot was developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li et al. (2018)</ref> to propose a solution to the problem of text segmentation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Koshorek et al. (2018)</ref> address text segmentation as a supervised learning problem and present a large dataset for this problem. Dialog acts identification could be seen as determining interlocutors intentions within a conversation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Wang et al. (2019)</ref> study the identification of intentions in emails in a workplace situation.</p><p>All these work give us some leads of experience to be carried out very soon with our data in order to approach our problem of threads constitution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we presented a method for building corporate corpora including different aspects and steps which allowed the creation of a pipeline to pseudo-anonymise data. Such a pipeline is a response to the constraints induced by the GDPR and the secrecy of correspondence compliance.</p><p>The process we described consists of several steps: first we prospected with our collaborators to obtain their consent agreement, this in order to be GDPR and secrecy of correspondence compliant; second we collected and pre-processed emails from Outlook mailboxes; the third step dealt with manual annotation and Named Entities Recognition; fourth, we performed data pseudo-anonymization. During the second step, we developed a tool called OutlookScraping that allowed us to collect a first batch of 11k emails on the workstations of 4 close collaborators out of 78 collaborators who gave their consent agreement.</p><p>All these steps contributed to the production of pseudo-anonymized data that we will use for our future work of thread constitution. For our constitution of threads problem, we will focus on conversations disentanglement, dialog acts identification and text segmentation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
